![Peter McLeavey](IMG_1795.jpg)

I took this photo just a couple of weeks before he passed on because it was the first time I'd ever seen this whole wall cleared and this sign is so handsome.  I had not been in here in a while.  

I didn't know him well, but about ten years ago, I would visit his gallery very regularly.  Sometimes we would chat.  On one of my earlier visits I asked if I could get his card.  He gave me this narrow old-school card which I have around here somewhere.  This guys was the real-deal.
