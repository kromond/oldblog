Since I got this phone I have taken way more photos than I had with my previous phone.  I just love this phone cam.  There are all kinds of crazy photo features too, like pano and other 3d-ish kind of things, and crazy 'beauty' settings that are just gonzo.  I love it all

 I had wanted to share a pano in 360 viewer but couldn't figure out how to host and share it in 360 view.  I'll try again another time
