This projected started more or less around Dec of 2014.  I was considering a project that makes use of the computer.  It had been quite a while since I though using a computer in my 'free' time was a good idea, since I had been working long hours doing creative work on a computer for my 'paid' time.  I mean I have a macbook and read email, watch youtube and whatnot... but in terms of creative work, I couldnt even bring my self to edit photos anymore.

But fortunately I took steps to address my issue.  I shifted my responsiblities and reduced my hours in my 'paid' time alowing me to recover from serious burnout.  After a surprisingly long time I began to replensh my creative lifeforce.

So when considering what I might do with computers in my own time, I decided to jump on the 'headmounteddisplay' bandwagon.  I felt pretty confident this will be 'a thing' and will need some creative content generators.  So I decided to stick my plow in that field.

One of my interests was to *not* make a game.  Games are great, those folks are making amazing things, but I don't really spend my time playing them and the content generation in that space is not different enough from my day job.

This lead me to investigate video, sound and narrative content for these hmd's and quickly found there is a lot of interesting questions there.  I also found there are a lot of other farmers plowing this same field, like in this [gizmodo article](http://gizmodo.com/the-insane-camera-rig-being-used-to-shoot-360-degree-oc-1682581101) but not a lot of detailed info or commercially available options

I bought a DK2 and new workstation around Feb while researching how I might build a camera and microphone array on the cheap
