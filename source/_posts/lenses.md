After a short while, I decide to get another camera, to run tests on.  Firmware tests and scripts, that sort of thing.  I also had this notion to see if I can use it more like a 'cinema' type camera.  Key to that would be some alternate lenses.  
I had seen that there are gopro examples out there of people putting alternate c-mount apperatuses, like the ['backbone ribcage'](http://backboneca.tumblr.com/).  

The gopro 'backbone' idea seems pretty fun, but it's pricy and requires signifigant modification to the camera by moving the sensor flush with the front of the cam.  Also I wasn't too sure if this mod would translate to my camera since it's not a gopro.

After browsing the lenses at http://peauproductions.com/, which indicated some of their lenses will [fit my camera](http://peauproductions.com/store/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=137_191), I went to aliexpress and picked out a few M12 security camera lenses at various price points.  I was particularly interested in one where I could change the focus and aperature.  Unfortunatly the M12 mount lenses don't seem to offer any with aperture control, but.... I did pick one with a vairable focal length

Here are a couple pictures.  I'll follow this post up with details on the lenses I bought
