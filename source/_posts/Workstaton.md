I'm new at this blog shit.  I feel like it could be useful to document the details from earlier in the year.

At the time, this is around Feb, I had got my workstation together thanks to the folks at the [Computer Lounge](computerlounge.co.nz).  I'm still pretty stoked at what they built me.  This was expected to be the most expensive aspect to my project and I wanted it to be fresh for a little while so I spent a bit. I was not too excited about windows but I didnt feel that I had too much of a choice plus I didn't want to spend too much time admin'ing this system.  They set it up and it's been pretty great.  Its not all choked up with bullshit software.  

Two of the better aspects to the whole thing: 

* This gaming keyboard, which was not something I though I'd really give a shit about but I was in a spending state and had just read about the whole mechanical switch thing and thought I'd have a go.  I got the Logitech G710.  Now I'm totally convinced and bought a second hand one for work, different one, coolermaster.  I make way less typing mistakes.  

* This long monitor.  It's this one LG UltraWide 29UM65-P 29" 21:9 2560x1080 IPS LED Monitor.  Suits my needs for now and this aspect is great.  I like it way better than two monitors

The card is GTX970. also bought the DK2.  I do wish I got a bigger ssdd
